# Twitter Automation Pipeline - PRD

## 1. Requirements Analysis

### Primary Objective
Create a robust, self-healing automation pipeline that works reliably for all future dates without manual intervention.

### Core Requirements
- Reliable bookmark extraction from Twitter daily
- Automatic error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Database storage of extracted bookmarks with analysis
- External API access for ChatGPT/artifacts consistently
- Monitoring and alerting when failures occur
- Fallback mechanisms when primary scraping fails

### Identified Issues from Investigation
1. Scraper Navigation Failures: Getting stuck on loading screens
2. Puppeteer API Incompatibility: waitForTimeout and waitForXPath not working
3. Twitter UI Changes: Selectors may have changed
4. Rate Limiting/Detection: Twitter may be blocking automation
5. No Failure Recovery: When scraper fails, no backup method exists
6. No Monitoring: Failures go undetected until manually checked

## 2. Technical Approach

### Multi-Layer Resilience Strategy
1. Primary Scraper Enhancement: Fix existing Puppeteer-based scraper
2. Backup Scraping Methods: Alternative extraction approaches
3. Smart Retry Logic: Exponential backoff with different strategies
4. Health Monitoring: Automated failure detection and reporting
5. Graceful Degradation: Continue working even with partial failures

### Alternative Solutions Considered
- API-based approach: Twitter API (limited access, expensive)
- Browser extension: More reliable but deployment complexity
- Multiple scraper instances: Redundancy but resource intensive
- Hybrid approach: Combine multiple methods for maximum reliability

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Scraper Fixes (High Priority)
1. Fix Puppeteer Compatibility Issues
   - Replace deprecated waitForTimeout with setTimeout
   - Replace waitForXPath with waitForFunction + evaluate
   - Update to latest Puppeteer API patterns
2. Enhance Navigation Robustness
   - Add multiple navigation strategies
   - Implement loading state detection
   - Add screenshot debugging for failures
   - Handle various Twitter page states
3. Improve Bookmark Extraction
   - Update selectors for current Twitter UI
   - Add multiple extraction strategies
   - Fallback to different DOM selectors
   - Handle empty results gracefully

### Phase 2: Error Recovery & Monitoring (Medium Priority)
1. Smart Retry Mechanisms
   - Exponential backoff for failures
   - Different retry strategies (new session, different approach)
   - Circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures
2. Health Monitoring System
   - Daily automation health checks
   - Automated alerts via email/notifications
   - Success/failure metrics tracking
   - Performance monitoring
3. Fallback Methods
   - Alternative scraping approaches
   - Manual data entry interfaces
   - External data source integration

### Phase 3: Long-term Reliability (Low Priority)
1. Advanced Anti-Detection
   - Browser fingerprint randomization
   - Proxy rotation capabilities
   - Human-like interaction patterns
2. Performance Optimization
   - Faster extraction methods
   - Reduced resource usage
   - Parallel processing capabilities

## 4. Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
1. Unit Tests: Individual scraper functions
2. Integration Tests: End-to-end pipeline testing
3. Failure Simulation: Test error recovery mechanisms
4. Performance Tests: Ensure speed and reliability

### Manual Testing
1. Daily Runs: Test automation daily for 1 week
2. Edge Cases: Various Twitter states and conditions
3. External Access: Verify ChatGPT/artifacts can access data
4. Recovery Testing: Manually trigger failures and verify recovery

## 5. Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Code Updates Required
- /Users/Subho/CascadeProjects/x-bookmarks-automation/github-actions-scraper.js
- /Users/Subho/CascadeProjects/x-bookmarks-automation/improved-scraper.js
- /Users/Subho/claude-code-install/twitter-automation-launcher/scripts/update_and_run.sh

### New Components Needed
- Health monitoring script
- Retry logic framework
- Alert notification system
- Backup scraping methods

### Infrastructure
- Monitoring dashboard
- Alert delivery system (email/Slack)
- Logging infrastructure
- Backup data sources

## 6. Review & Validation

### Success Criteria
1. 7-day reliability test: Automation works successfully for 7 consecutive days
2. Failure recovery: Automatically recovers from at least 2 different failure types
3. External access: ChatGPT/artifacts can consistently access current-day data
4. Zero manual intervention: No manual fixes required during test period

### Monitoring Metrics
- Daily scraping success rate (target: >95%)
- Time from scraping to database availability (target: <10 minutes)
- External API response time (target: <2 seconds)
- Recovery time from failures (target: <30 minutes)
