# Summary of Attempts to Fix Scraper Issue

1. **Initial Execution**: The scraper was executed, but it failed due to missing environment variables `X_USERNAME` and `X_PASSWORD`.

2. **Setting Environment Variables**: The environment variables were set in the `.env` file, but the scraper still could not recognize them.

3. **Script Modifications**: 
   - The script was modified to ensure that the `dotenv` package was correctly configured to load the environment variables.
   - Console logs were added to check if the environment variables were being loaded.

4. **Hardcoding Values**: 
   - Hardcoded values for `X_USERNAME` and `X_PASSWORD` were added to the script for testing, but the script still failed to recognize the variables.

5. **Installation of dotenv**: The `dotenv` package was installed to ensure it was available for loading environment variables.

6. **Path Verification**: The path to the `.env` file was explicitly set in the script, but the variables remained undefined.

### Conclusion:
Despite multiple attempts to load the environment variables correctly, the scraper continues to fail due to the same error. Further investigation into the environment setup may be required.
